      <h1>What is Rigor Samsa?</h1>
      <p>
        There was a time when I did not consider my craft to be good enough to be sold but 
        I already had a dream to reach that point when I would dear to do so. While improving
         my craft I was thinking about the name of my store, it had to be special for me and my
          story. I knew that I want it to be a bit mysterious and elegant, I was always attracted
           to it, maybe because that I wanted to be elegant and mysterious myself, which tells 
           that I am kind of an opposite in real life. One day I stumbled upon the <em>The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</em> by John Koenig and it resonated
             with my dreamy mind. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It was full of invented words to name complex feelings that didn’t have a name up to then.
         And Rigor Samsa really stuck with me! I will take a piece of the book to show you what it
          means: “n. a kind of psychological exoskeleton that can protect you from pain and contain
           your anxieties, but always ends up cracking under pressure or hollowed out by time — and
            will keep growing back again and again, until you develop a more sophisticated emotional
             structure, held up by a strong and flexible spine, built less like a fortress than a
              cluster of treehouses.”. Isn’t it poetic? 
        </p>
        <p>
        It reminded me how I, being a sensitive soul, would put on a mask of indifference and would
         push away other people out of fear to be ridiculed for actually being sensitive. I would
          hide my tender feelings behind thick walls of my castle, I felt misunderstood and lonely
           because I put myself into a tower… Then with time, pain, experience, repeating mistakes,
            being desperate to be loved, I was breaking under my own expectations until I just got
             so tired that I finally loosened the grip upon myself. I became more flexible, I
              understood that you cannot be brave if you sit behind the walls, you have to go out
               and show yourself. I began to see that happiness lives in smallest things and creation
                was one of them for me. So I found my strength in flexibility, not in rigidity as I
                 thought before. So being Rigor Samsa for me is being flexibly strong. Interestingly,
                  my favourite media to work with is polymer clay, which after baking is still a bit
                   flexible and strong at the same time, isn’t it perfect? 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I checked if anyone is using that name already I found a music band called
             <em>Rigor Samsa</em> so I added one more word to it to clarify and the name of my
              brand became <em>Rigor Samsa Crafts</em>. The next step was to create a logo.
               It took several years until it slowly got polished into this final shape, for now at least.
                Especially I love an idea that came to me just recently that the small logo
                 of the brand looks like sideways contracted version of the big one. When
                  the ornamental border as if flexibly shortens into a rounder shape.
                   I thought that it was very symbolic. Maybe someday if on top of web
                    development I will learn animation too, maybe I will finalize the logo
                     with the unfolding motion. Time will show. Thank you for listening
                      and being curious!
            </p>
