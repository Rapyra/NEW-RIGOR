      <h1>A bit about myself</h1>
      <p> Since I was a kid I wanted to be an artist. My mom said that she could put some paper and pencils for me and I could sit for hours drawing something. My mom grew up into adulthood at the time of uncertainty in my country, Lithuania. When I was born she was in her mid thirties, Lithuania became independent, and another decade of uncertainty began. 
        She wanted all the best for me and she encouraged my artistic soul to be trained in natural sciences in an effort to ensure for me a more stable future.
      </p> 
      <p>I was and still partly am a person who thrives on positive affirmations. 
        I did my best to find my own way through the world of hard sciences in highshool to please my mom. I still liked arts and tried to
        apply for a college of graphic design but I also liked plants and animals, 
        though I wasn't stellar at biology and hated chemistry. Due to a streak of curious events (it is a whole separate story) 
        I still got not just into university, but into a programme of biology and enviromental sciences (it is whole separate story too). So, to make this story 
        short, at the end I did my best and stomped that path until I ended up in Finland, at the
        University of Helsinki studying general microbiology 
        for my PhD degree. I am a curious person who likes to invent, am sensitive to conflicts and hate going through others just to succeed... Unfortunately, 
        to excel in science further on conflicts of interest and competition was
        waiting for me, there were no options just to stay at the same level. So after graduation I made a stop to think what 
        I actually want my life to be. So here I am at the moment, figuring out what to do further on. 
      </p>
      <p>If you will stay tuned, later on I will tell more stories about how, when and why I began working with polymer clay and resin and why earrings. I will also share 
          stories of inspiration, techniques, struggles, thought processes and many other things. And what it means for me <em>"Stay flexibly strong - be Rigor Samsa!"</em>. <br> 
        <br>
         <em>Sincerely,<br>
             JS a.k.a RN of Rigor Samsa</em>
