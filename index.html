        <p><strong>This blog is meant to share and describe my process of creating earrings</strong> that I am selling at <em>Rigor Samsa Crafts</em> shop on Etsy. I created this page as well as my crafts from scratch and it calls for perpetual learning and improving. 
          I have many hobbies and passions so I wanted a place where I can share at least several of them with people who are interested in crafting or creations of others. For that purpose I began learning web development too. 
          I wish to inspire you to try out crafting or at least to show you how much thought and effort goes into handmade accessories. I will see you around. Be flexibly stong!

    <h1>A bit about myself</h1>
    <p>
      I am <strong>Julija Svirskaite a.k.a Rapyra Nefere of Rigor Samsa Crafts</strong>. Since I was a kid I wanted to be an artist. My mom said that she could put some paper and pencils for me and I could sit for hours drawing something. My mom grew up into adulthood at the time of uncertainty in my country, Lithuania. When I was born she was in her mid thirties, Lithuania became independent, and another decade of uncertainty began. 
      She wanted all the best for me and she encouraged my artistic soul to be trained in natural sciences in an effort to ensure for me a more stable future. ...  <br><a href="A bit about myself.html">Read more &#8811;</a></p>

    <h1>What is Rigor Samsa?</h1>
    <p class="okP">There was a time when I did not consider my craft to be good enough to be sold but 
      I already had a dream to reach that point when I would dear to do so. While improving my craft I 
      was thinking about the name of my store, it had to be special for me and my story. I knew that I 
      want it to be a bit mysterious and elegant, I was always attracted to it, maybe because that I 
      wanted to be elegant and mysterious myself, which tells that I am kind of an opposite in real life.  One day I stumbled upon the <em>The Dictionary of 
        Obscure Sorrows</em> by John Koenig and it resonated with my dreamy mind. ...  <br><a href="What is Rigor Samsa.html">Read more &#8811;</a></p>

      ... in a small town in the middle of a small country lived a small girl. She was going to middle school and after school she went to the nearby library
       where her mother worked as a librarian. She would read books about the world and interact with younger kids. And one day library got a new book, 
       which name is unknown by now. The book was about a magical substance which was malleable like a usual clay and yet it became a sturdy plastic
