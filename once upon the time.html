      <h1>Once upon the time...</h1>
      <p>
        … in a small town in the middle of a small country lived a small girl. She was going to the 
        middle school and after school she went to the nearby library where her mother worked as a librarian. 
        She would read books about the world and interact with younger kids. One day library got a new book, 
        which name is unknown by now. The book was about a magical substance, polymer clay, which was malleable 
        like a usual clay and yet it became a sturdy plastic after cooking it in a simple home oven? 
        </p>
        <p>
            She already then knew that for real clay you needed a special oven. Furthermore, that clay was so 
            colourful and vivid, it sparked so many creative ideas in her head that it made her little heart beat 
            faster from excitement. Unfortunately, at that time that material was not available in her small town, 
            or in the whole country. Time passed, internet appeared, she here and there saw how other people used 
            the material, a polymer clay, and she awed on how versatile it was. She began collecting a folder of 
            ideas what she would do if she had polymer clay. Just in case such a day came by.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Even more time went by, she left her small country to study abroad, times changed too, many things 
            became more easily available. The girl became a woman, she got salary and  some time to spare for hobbies. 
            Once while visiting a craft shop she saw and recognised polymer clay packages sold there. At that moment memories, 
            the ideas and excitement flooded her… and that is how the story of a happy crafting began.
