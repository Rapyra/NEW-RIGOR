        <p>
          It took me a while to begin learning Finnish language. 
          At first I just arrived for an internship, three months, then 
          constantly prolonged fellowship… Then I began my PhD and planned 
          to leave Finland when I graduate so during all that time I didn’t 
          see a point to learn one of the most difficult languages. I was 
          content, many people spoke English, Google auto translated all their 
          pages, almost all friends were international and spoke English. 
          Definitely no need to know the fourth language. 
          Consequently, I graduated, many things can change in four years.

          In four years I found friends here, I began liking the country, 
          weather was too similar to Lithuanian  to be bothered by it too much too. 
          Finland slowly creped into my heart without me noticing it. So I decided 
          to try and stay, especially that government’s social support was guaranteed 
          for a year after graduation. Long story short, it didn’t go smoothly! 
          After many attempts to find a job in local industry I realized that if I 
          want to stay here I have to try harder and begin learning a hard language. 
          I began attending Finnish language courses and apparently doodle earrings on 
          the pages of the printed exercise pages. Inspiration really can come at any time, 
          maybe my brain really needed a minute or two to chill with some creativity and 
          then return to the world of strict rules. Who knows. I did not use any of these yet, 
          bur I am excited to think them someday soon. Stay tuned!
